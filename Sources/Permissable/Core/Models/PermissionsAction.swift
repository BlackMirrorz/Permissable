 An enumeration describing the recommended action for a permission based on its current status.

 - request: The permission has not been requested yet, so the app should request it.
 - openSettings: The permission has already been requested (and was denied/restricted), so the app should prompt the user to open settings.
 - none: The permission is already authorized; no action is needed.
