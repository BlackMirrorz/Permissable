 Protocol defining the behavior for managing a specific app  permissions.

 Any type conforming to this protocol is responsible for handling  the request and management of a specific permission type.

 - Requirements:
   - Define how the permission's current status is retrieved. getAuthorizationStatus() -> PermissionRequestResult
   - Provide a method to request authorization.
   - Determine if the permission has been previously requested.
   - Offer a way to open the app's settings for the user to manually adjust permissions.
 */

   Retrieves the current authorization status for the permission.

   - Returns: The current status of the permission as a `PermissionType`.
   - Possible values:
     - `notDetermined`: Permission has not been requested yet.
     - `restricted`: Permission is restricted by system policies or parental controls.
     - `denied`: Permission was explicitly denied by the user.
     - `limited`: Permission was granted with limited access (if applicable).
     - `authorized`: Full access to the permission has been granted.

   - If the permission is authorized, return `.none`.
   - If the permission is not authorized and has already been requested, return `.openSettings`.
   - Otherwise, return `.request`.
